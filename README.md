# GCI 2019 - An Archive

This is basically an archive of all my work I did during GCI 2019.

This is supposed to be a personal archive, so I don't think you should be reading this.

I could've made all this public, but I don't have the consent of the mentors to make my conversations with them public, so I'll keep it private for now.

P.S. @PseudoCodeNerd isn't mentioned in this much, but he helped me a LOT with all of this. Madhav ily
