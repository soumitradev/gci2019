# Add Meta Description tags to every page on JuliaLang.org


Based on our SEO findings during Google Code-In, the Julia Lang site lacks Meta Description tags on all of its pages.

[Per the thread here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/www.julialang.org/issues/501) add the Meta Description tags to all the pages where they are needed.

Use [Google's lighthouse tool](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) to confirm that the changes you made resolved the Meta Description issue.
