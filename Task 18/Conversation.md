> Hi! I have added the Meta Description tags, and built a preview of the site here: https://julia-preview.netlify.com/.

> On using the Lighthouse tool, I found that adding the Meta Descriptions does not change the SEO score of the website (I think this is because Google says that the Meta Description tags don't directly affect the SEO, but they do affect the SEO indirectly since people are more likely to click on links with good descriptions. This only affects click-through rate (CTR), which affects the SEO.)

> Source for this information: https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html

> Quote from source:
> "Even though we sometimes use the description meta tag for the snippets we show, we still don't use the description meta tag in our ranking."

> They did say that they rarely use the description, but that seems a bit odd since their tool itself suggests adding the description tags.

> Anyways, the Lighthouse tool doesn't ask us to add the Meta Description tags anymore. I have attached both the Lighthouse SEO reports for the website before adding the description, and after adding the descriptions.

> Issue for the same task: https://github.com/JuliaLang/www.julialang.org/issues/532

> I looked a bit deeper and I found out that we can even convert the existing .md files to .html to improve the website's SEO even more. Maybe this could be automated? Maybe this could be another task?
