# Add install instructions to JuliaLang.org


For this task, you will do the following:

Add install instructions for ONE of the main Operating Systems and how to add binaries to the path on that OS so Julia can be run from the command line.

Step 1: Check out the download section of the JuliaLang website: [https://julialang.org/downloads/](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

Step 2: Open an issue [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/www.julialang.org) with the Operating System you will be opening an issue for. Make sure that you don't do instructions for a platform that someone else is already working on.

Step 3: [Edit this page](https://github.com/JuliaLang/www.julialang.org/blob/master/downloads/index.html) with the install instructions. Follow the instructions on the readme for the repo to build the website and serve it locally.

Open a Pull Request to the main repo and submit a picture of the updated website being served locally.
