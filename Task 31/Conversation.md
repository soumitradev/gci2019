> Thanks! Just added the repo to the org, and replaced the 'hooman' with 'human' because I realized it's not funny.

> Awesome work! Just added you as a member of the JuliaGaming Org so you should be able to move the repo there. Keep up the great work!

> Hi there! I have finished the game and uploaded it to a GitHub repo here:
> https://github.com/soumitradev/TicTacToe

> The code is extensively commented, and the README includes Gameplay.

> The AI I implemented used Minimax, and I have also added varying difficulty levels for Singleplayer. I believe I have done most of the explaining on the repo, so I don't think I need to explain everything here again.

> I have licensed my repo under the MIT License: https://github.com/soumitradev/TicTacToe/blob/master/LICENSE

> I feel I have put quite a bit of effort into this, and I would like to add this to the JuliaGaming (https://github.com/JuliaGaming) Organisation. Could you help me with that?
