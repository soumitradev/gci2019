# Create a short "Advanced" level Julia Code Snippet for 30-seconds-of-Julia


Create a snippet for the [30-seconds-of-Julia repo](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-julia).

**Make sure this task is Advanced level. See the Python repo for examples of Intermediate tasks**

You should:

*   Open a Pull Request with the word "WIP" in the title to claim a specific exercise.

*   Look at the existing snippets in the repo to model the formatting

*   Look at [30-Seconds-of-Python snippets](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-python/tree/master/snippets) or other languages in the 30-seconds org to find possible snippets to create in Julia

*   Finish the pull request with your original markdown file that includes the example.

**You should not:**

*   Copy other peoples code or work

*   Make snippets using built-in functions. It's important that you don't create a snippet for something that already exists in base Julia. If the snippet is to see if the elements of an array are unique, and Julia has an `isunique()` function, then **do not** create this snippet.

Look to the [Julia docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) for refe
