So, I would like to license my work (The 1 snippet) under the CC0 1.0 License since the repo is licensed under the same. I just wanted to explicitly point this out.

> Hi! I have added an advanced difficulty snippet to the repo. Since my previous pull request hasn't been reviewed by the maintainer Chalarangelo, the commit I made to add the new snippet went back into my old pull request.

> I have added luhn.md which checks if a number is luhn-verified or not according to the Luhn Algorithm. I have adapted the idea of creating a luhn-checking algorithm from here, although the code was entirely written by me: https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code/blob/ebbb22db7cddbaac7f33c5432fe5600b2e78df42/snippets/luhnCheck.md

> My pull request has been edited to include both the Intermediate snippets and the Advanced snippets since the commit automatically added luhn.md to my previous pull request. You can find it here: https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-julia/pull/28
