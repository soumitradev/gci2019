> Hey there! I have drawn a snowy landscape that looks simple at first, but uses complex features of Luxor.jl to add attention to detail. I have uploaded the script as a Jupyter Notebook on Gist. I have included explanation to the code both in the form of Markdown at the start of the Notebook, and in the code in the form of comments.
