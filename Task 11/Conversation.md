So, I would like to license my work (The 4 snippets) under the CC0 1.0 License since the repo is licensed under the same. I just wanted to explicitly point this out.

> Hi there! I have added 4 new snippets to the repo and have created an issue for each of them:
> geometric_mean.md: https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-julia/issues/14
> harmonic_mean.md: https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-julia/issues/15
> bifurcate.md: https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-julia/issues/16
> bifurcate_by.md: https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-julia/issues/17

> I have also made a Pull Request for all 4 of them: https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-julia/pull/18

> I added the geometric_mean and harmonic_mean ones because an arithmetic mean (average) one was already added, and I wanted to complete the collection.

> The bifurcate and bifurcate_by snippets are adapted from the 30-seconds-of-python repo. Their links on the python repo:
> https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-python/blob/master/snippets/bifurcate.md
> https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-python/blob/master/snippets/bifurcate_by.md

All the 4 are of intermediate level, and are my original work.
