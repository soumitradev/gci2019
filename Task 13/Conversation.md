> Section 5.1 (c) in https://codein.withgoogle.com/student-terms/ states that every task output should be licensed under an appropriate open source license. So, I would like to license my work (The 3 snippets) under the CC0 1.0 License since the repo is licensed under the same. I just wanted to explicitly point this out.

> Hi! I have submitted 3 new snippets all of intermediate difficulty to the repo:

> intersection_by.md: Gets intersection of 2 lists after applying a function on each of their elements. Adapted from: https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-python/blob/master/snippets/intersection_by.md

> longest.md: Gets element with maximum length() value. Adapted from: https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-python/blob/master/snippets/longest_item.md

> root_mean_square.md: Gets the root mean square of arguments passed. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square

> I added the root_mean_square.md one because there are lot of scientific applications that require Root Mean Square such as Gas Laws, Alternating Current, Statistics, etc, but I didn't see it anywhere.
