> Hi there! Sorry for submitting this late, this took me a lot of time to edit.

> I have made a tutorial series on how to get started with making games in Julia using the example of making a complete TicTacToe game. This took about 10 videos ~11 minutes each. This is actually a tutorial for making the game here: https://github.com/JuliaGaming/TicTacToe

> I have uploaded the videos and created a playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-VRHDC00fyhcNFBqWdBbR0tejqZ8jYa

> I have linked code in the description, and have licensed every video under the CC BY 3.0 license: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797468?hl=en

> The article does not specify the version but links to the actual license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode

> I have tried my best to make the audio quality good, but I feel it could be improved by redoing the voiceover on videos.

> GitHub repo for the code I write in these videos: https://github.com/soumitradev/youtube-tutorial
