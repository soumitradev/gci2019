# Create a "How To" YouTube video about an aspect of the Julia Language

Per the thread [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/www.julialang.org/issues/455), we are trying to make the Julia Language more accessible and inclusive of everyone!

One of the possible ways to do this is by creating various "How To" videos and uploading them to youtube.

For this task, create a simple 5-minute - 10-minute video going over how to do something you think is difficult in Julia or that you find interesting ( ML, Data Science, NLP, etc.).

Upload the video to YouTube and paste the link here.

Note:

*   If there's code that the viewer needs, link that code in the description of the video (in notebook format).
*   You do not need to show your face or talk about yourself.
*   If you try to do something more complex, it's best to break the video up into smaller 5-10 minute videos.
*   Please ensure that the audio and video quality is good ( it can be hard to learn if there's cracking mic's or blurry screens).

Please ask questions if you have them!
