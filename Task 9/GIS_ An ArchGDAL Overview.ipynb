    "# GIS: An ArchGDAL Overview\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.1 What are GIS Databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "GIS stands for Geographic Information System. GIS databases are databases that contain geographical data. For instance, a GIS database could contain location information about crimes and could help analyze previous crimes and prevent them in the future. Another example could be visualizing the outbreak of a disease, recognizing patterns in the data and preventing or limiting the spread of the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "GIS databases also contain layers that can be accessed to collect different types of information for a given place. For example, we can visualize rainfall distribution, wind speeds, and the average temperature at a place and that could yield important meteorological results. All these different parameters would exist in different layers since they represent different types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "GIS can give us deeper insights about issues that challenge the world, predict future events, help us understand trends and so much more. It truly is a versatile form of data that has a lot of potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 A Deeper Look\n",
    "\n",
    "GIS databases are of two types: vector and raster. Vector databases contain information about discrete objects such as lines, points, areas, labels, etc. Raster databases, on the other hand, contain continuous information such as heatmaps, distribution charts, imagery, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector databases are generally used to map and label things that have fixed boundaries and can be mapped discretely. This includes streets, states, buildings, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster databases are generally used to visualize distributions, satellite imagery, elevations, weather data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Where does ArchGDAL come in?\n",
    "\n",
    "GDAL stands for Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, which is an open-source library that can process GIS data. Currently, the project is being maintained by OSGeo and is being updated frequently. It is released under the X/MIT license and is mainly written in C and C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, many translation libraries exist that can interface between a given programming language and GDAL. One example is ArchGDAL.jl which interfaces between GDAL and Julia. It is, in fact, a high-level API for GDAL and builds upon GDAL.jl.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 The Arch Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "ArchGDAL also follows the Arch principles while developing and maintaining their library. The principles are:\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: without unnecessary additions or modifications. (i) Preserves GDAL Data Model, and makes available GDAL/OGR methods without trying to mask them from the user. (ii) minimal dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modernity**: ArchGDAL strives to maintain the latest stable release versions of GDAL as long as systemic package breakage can be reasonably avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pragmatism**: The principles here are only useful guidelines. Ultimately, design decisions are made on a case-by-case basis through developer consensus. Evidence-based technical analysis and debate are what matter, not politics or popular opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User-Centrality**: Whereas other libraries attempt to be more user-friendly, ArchGDAL shall be user-centric. It is intended to fill the needs of those contributing to it, rather than trying to appeal to as many users as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatility**: ArchGDAL will strive to remain small in its assumptions about the range of user needs, and to make it easy for users to build their own extensions/conveniences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These principles are adapted from the original Arch Linux principles which can be found [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux#Principles).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.8 Working with files\n",
    "\n",
    "ArchGDAL allows the following functions to work with files:\n",
    "- `createcopy()`\n",
    "- `update()`\n",
    "- `create()`\n",
    "- `read()`\n",
    "\n",
    "`createcopy()`: Creates a copy of the database passed as parameter.\n",
    "`update()`: Opens a database with write permissions.\n",
    "`create()`: Creates a new empty database.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: Sequential write formats (Like PNG and JPEG) do not support `create()`, but do implement `createcopy()`.\n",
    "Also, some drivers only implement `create()`, but not `createcopy()`. In that case, `createcopy()` will be used as a mechanism when calling `create()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`read()`: Opens the database in read-only mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.9 Accessing Data from Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "To access individual fields and features (such as lines, points, labels, etc.) in vector databases, we have some methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "`ArchGDAL.getgeomfield(feature, i)`: Gets the geometric field in the feature at index `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ArchGDAL.getfield(feature, i)`: Gets the field in the feature at index `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ArchGDAL.ngeomfield(feature)`: Gets the number of geometric fields in the `feature`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ArchGDAL.nfield(feature)`: Gets the number of fields in the `feature`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In raster databases, we have many methods that get the attributes of the database. Going over all these methods is out of the scope of this introduction, and the docs for these methods can be found [here](http://yeesian.com/ArchGDAL.jl/latest/rasters.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, ArchGDAL is a very powerful tool and can be used for a variety of applications. This was only a brief exploration of the tool, and there is much more to this tool than just this. Check the repo out [here](https://github.com/yeesian/ArchGDAL.jl), and the docs for this tool [here](http://yeesian.com/ArchGDAL.jl/latest/).\n",
