# Post a question and answer on Stackoverflow.com with the Julia Tag

**Warning: If you have never used Stack Overflow before, please read their community guidelines on how to ask a good question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).** If you do not take the time to write a good question and answer, you will likely get downvoted by the community at large and lose the ability to post questions on the site.

For this task, you will find read the [Julia Docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) and then post a question and subsequent answer to that question on Stack Overflow.

You should:

*   Write the Question and answer as if you are genuinely posing the question and genuinely answering the question. See an example of this done well [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58997651/how-to-use-operators-as-functions-in-julia/58997652#58997652).
*   Make sure the question has not already been asked. If you post a duplicate question the Stack Overflow Moderators will close it and you will no longer be able to post.
*   Post both a question AND answer to that question.
    *   Be sure to post something useful that another Julia user may be searching for. I tend to post things that I learned and were contrary to what I thought was correct in case others are also wrong.
*   Make sure the question is tagged "julia".

If you have doubts about what a good question and answer looks like, please submit here before you post on Stack Overflow.

Link the question on Stack Overflow once it has been posted.
