# Set up Julia and code some Advent of Code puzzles! (Beginner)

If you want to write any Julia code you will need to have Julia installed. On the JuliaLang website you can [download](https://julialang.org/downloads/) an installer for your platform. Version 1.3 just came out and should work fine.

To make working with Julia a little more comfortable you can install an IDE or a plugin for your favorite text editor.

*   You probably get the most features bundled with [Juno](https://junolab.org/) (for example a debugger and a profiler) which is built on top of Atom.
*   We also have a plugin for [VS Code](https://www.julia-vscode.org/),
*   instructions to [use Julia with Sublime](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/HowToUseJuliaWithSublimeText3) and
*   [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) supports Julia, so you can use Jupyter notebooks or JupyterLab.
*   Of course you can also just use a terminal and a text editor.

Now, let's write some code. [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a website which posts a series of fun coding puzzles each December. Just the right thing to get started!

**Collect 3 stars from either year [2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017) or [2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) and share your documented code with your mentors.** (The first days of each year are a little easier so you can pick the right challenge for yourself.)

For more information you can visit Julia's [getting started page](https://julialang.org/learning/getting-started). If you have any trouble, [this task](https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/tasks/6372272844046336/preview/) and the [Julia community page](https://julialang.org/community/) list some of the places where you can find help.

By the way, the 2019 Advent of Code event is currently going on, so if you want a fresh challenge each day you can join that as well. Of course, this is not required for this task.
