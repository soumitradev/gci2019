# Create a Julia-Themed Sticker/Button Design

Create a design for a Julia sticker or buttons that could be handed out at meetups, like [these](https://twitter.com/shellycrossland/status/1044247783178268673) stickers and buttons:

The design should:

*   Be in the shape of a circle (suitable for pin/sticker) or hexagon
*   Use at most 4 colors, for example the [Julia colors](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia-logo-graphics#color-definitions)
*   Use fonts and images that are public domain only (see [https://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/public-domain-faq.html](https://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/public-domain-faq.html)), not requiring attribution (cite sources)
*   Use large font sizes that will be readable on a 3-4 cm button
*   Incorporate the Julia logo
*   Use a short phrase or slogan of your choice to promote the language. For example: "designed for performance", or "walks like Python, runs like C". Use your imagination!

Include a licensing phrase with your submission (use a separate text file)

Along with your finished graphic, upload a screenshot showing how you made it.
