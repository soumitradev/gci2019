> Very good work, and you've provided many different colour alternatives, which is great. In future I'd suggest keeping the text larger if you can, since it will be quite small on a badge.

> Hello! I have designed some stickers, and have attached them as a .zip file. The LICENSE.md file is included in that. Since I have used the Julia logo (which is in CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, I can only release these designs under the same license due to the ShareAlike part of the license. However, I have used only Public Domain fonts and images to make these designs. I have used the following media other than the Julia logo:
> 1. Font Comfortaa: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa?selection.family=Comfortaa
> 2. Python Logo file: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Python-logo-notext.svg
> 3. C Logo file: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_C_Programming_Language_logo.svg
> 4. The "Hello my name is " image: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hello_my_name_is_sticker.svg

> All the mentioned links have the license of these works. Again, they are all in Public Domain, but due to the license of the Julia logo, I have to publish it under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
> I used Photoshop to make these graphics. I have included both .psd and .png formats in my file.
> The screenshot of Photoshop is also attached.
