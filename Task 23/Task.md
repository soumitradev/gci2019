# Complete the Parallel Computing course on JuliaAcademy.com

For this task, you will just be doing a lot of Learning!

*   Sign up for [JuliaAcademy](https://juliaacademy.com/)
*   Take the Intro to Julia course and finish it 100%.
*   Upload a screenshot here of your completed course
*   Upload feedback about the course to [this thread](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/JuliaAcademyMaterials/issues/27). Note that the comments do not need to be all positive. We are looking for feedback to improve the experience for students learning Julia!

**PLEASE DO NOT COPY OTHER STUDENTS WORK!**

Please make sure that feedback is thoughtful and in-depth. The feedback should include 2 - 3 actionable items we can take to improve the course. This means that just saying you agree with what everyone else said is not considered quality feedback and neither is just repeating what other students have already brought up. Feedback must be original and new.
