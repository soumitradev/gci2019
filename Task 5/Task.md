# Write a blog post about how to do 0-based indexing in Julia

Julia arrays are 1-based unlike many other programming languages. Sometimes there are cases where 0-based indexing is more convenient e.g. reading chunks of data from a byte array coming from a binary file. The task is to learn how to use OffsetArrays.jl package and write a blog post about how to do that.
