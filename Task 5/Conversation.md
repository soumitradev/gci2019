> Another thing: The article on medium.com is marked under the organization "Analytics Vidhya" because this group of Data Science writers wanted to feature my article. The new post on medium.com might be edited by the editors at Analytics Vidhya, so I would recommend evaluating the Google Docs document I submitted originally so that you could see my original work.


> Thanks for the help on this task by the way!

> Hey Soumitra! Great job. I liked the article. One thing to note, perhaps it would be better to have this as a GitHub gist? The images of the code are not formatted and google docs are not usually the best places people go to find info about programming. Either way, great job and keep up the incredible work.

> Hi! I have written the blog post as a Google Doc, and have included an example implementation of 0-based arrays with code included. The link to the doc is: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mSfn1qR4PcoKjsTx7gYztLIKUPA6bvsDZhKtss3VCdc/edit?usp=sharing

> I have made the document available as Public Domain. The doc does not use any material not in Public Domain.

> I have implemented the 0-based array in a circular list, since it utilizes a fundamental property of 0-based indexing to work.
