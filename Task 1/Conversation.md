> Hi! I had written the code by myself. Since solving quadratics is quite common, is there a way to prove this?

> Looks Good!. But wanted to know did you had written the whole code by yourself or you had just modified/run it on your system.

> I wrote a Quadratic Equation Solver as my first script. (The Quadratic Formula is my favorite formula) The REPL execution screenshot and the script itself are attached. I solved the equation xÂ² - 5x + 6 = 0 as an example in my screenshot. It only calculates real roots (if any). I have included comments in my script to explain how my script works.

> I have also joined the Slack using the handle soumitradev. It would be great if you could accept my invitation request!
