> Hi! I have added the JSONtoTest converter as a new PR since the other one was closed. Again, sorry for the late reply.

> Great work, that's really helpful already! Could you add your files to the PR in the repo?

> I've left a few comments on the PR itself on how the exercise could be made more interesting in the context of Exercism. It would be great if you take a look and let me know if you want to do those changes or not. I'll leave it up to you.

> Thanks for adding the exercise and taking a shot at creating a test generator! :)

> Hi, I have tried to implement the converter, but my script works only on some exercises like Bob, Anagram, Transpose, Reverse-String, Hello-World, etc. I have not tested my script on all the exercises, but most of them end up failing due to some TypeError. The original python script I used for my own task used hardcoded dict key values and so worked. However, implementing the same in Julia while also generalizing to all exercises wasn't easy. I have submitted my best attempt at the Julia conversion, and my original Python Script I used specifically for my exercise. Since this is an optional part of the task, I don't think full completion of the optional part should be necessary to evaluate the task as a whole.

> Sure, Iâ€™ll try to convert it into Julia as soon as possible.

> Hi! I'll take a proper look and review it in the morning, too tired right now. Just briefly wanted to address your comment.

>> I have come up with a way to convert the JSON test data to the test suite, but it relies on the input given to the exercise I implemented and is written in Python, not in Julia. However, since it is an optional part of the task, if this doesn't fit the requirements of this task, it would be great if you ignored this optional part and marked the task as complete.

> We can't really make use of it if it's written in Python, but perhaps you could translate it to Julia? Or at least share it. Maybe upload it as a gist (gist.github.com/) and link it in the PR.

> We value quality over quantity, so it definitely wouldn't be a disadvantage to do the optional part, though. If you want you could also work on the optional part later if you find some extra time and submit it then.
