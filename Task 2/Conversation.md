> Another thing: The article on medium.com is marked under the organization "Analytics Vidhya" because this group of Data Science writers wanted to feature my article. The new post on medium.com might be edited by the editors at Analytics Vidhya, so I would recommend evaluating the Google Docs document I submitted originally so that you could see my original work.

> Thanks for the help on this task by the way!
