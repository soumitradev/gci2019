# Write a blog post about 1-based vs 0-based array indexing

Julia arrays are 1-based unlike many other programming languages. There are relative merits between 0-based and 1-based indexing of arrays. The blog post should describe when 1-based indexing is better than 0-based indexing and vice versa. The post may present some code samples in Julia for various use cases.
