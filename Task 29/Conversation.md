> Hi! I have finished the one-page summary and attached it. I used Photoshop to make it.

> I fit it all in a 8.7 x 8.5 inch paper (weird size, I know), at 600dpi giving a resolution of 5220x5100 px.

> I have included credits in the document, but here's a copy of it for quick reference:
> Background by Michael Atkins on Toptal. The image is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 License.
