> Hi there! Since the previous repo maintainer did not want the Pull Request labeler, I closed the PR instead of forcing him to add things he didn't want.

> This time, I have made the PR labeler for Gtk.jl. I have also created an issue for the new labels to be added.

> My PR: https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Gtk.jl/pull/476
> The issue: https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Gtk.jl/issues/475
> The Package: https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Gtk.jl
