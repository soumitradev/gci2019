# Add a Pull Request labeler to Julia packages on GitHub

GitHub provides a template to create a [GitHub action that will label Pull requests with proper labels](https://github.com/actions/labeler).

Create this labeler component for a package of your choosing in the [Julia Registry](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General) or your own un-published Julia Package.

An example of the labeler in action can be found in the [.github folder of MakieGallery.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/MakieGallery.jl/tree/master/.github).

The final outcome of this task will be a Pull Request to a package in the Julia Registry (or your own un-published Julia Package) that will create a GitHub action to appropriately label Pull Request to that repository.
