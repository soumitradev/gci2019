# Write a simple online app in WebIO and Interact

Interact.jl is a package with UI widgets like sliders, buttons, check boxes and text boxes that can be used to make interactive exploration of concepts.

This task involves choosing a simple example, maybe a clone of http://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/building-web-app-julia-differentialequations-jl-online/ using Interact.jl and WebIO. Or choose any other example UI you can think of. The task would involve recreating this UI using WebIO and Interact as a web page on a local machine and documenting the process. Ideally the UI would be deployed publicly online, but that's a separate task. It's easy to show that the demo works in Atom and IJulia, but it's not required for this task.
