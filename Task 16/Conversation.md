> Hey there! I have made a Tech News bot that retweets announcements and news from official tech company accounts. It uses a simple needle-in-haystack filter to check if a tweet is considered news, and retweets these tweets. It runs every 5 minutes using Github Actions (News is fast, especially when you're reporting for ~30 companies at once), and retweets the tweets it deems news.

> More documentation and explanation is available on the repo: https://github.com/**Soumitradev/Twitter_Tech_News_Bot

> My bot's account is here: https://twitter.com/TechNewsBot1
