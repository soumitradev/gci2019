# Design a quiz for the Foundations of Machine Learning course on JuliaAcademy

**This task is designed for students who have completed the task titled: "_Complete the "Foundations of Machine Learning" course on JuliaAcademy.com_"**

Create a simple 7-10 question multiple-choice quiz (it can have less than 7-10 questions if the video is short). Each question should have 4 choices.

Topics must be picked from the below list:

*   Representing Data with Models
*   Building Models
*   Model Complexity
*   What is Learning?
*   What are Neurons?

**[Please claim your topic on this thread](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/JuliaAcademyMaterials/issues/50)**

_Note that these quizzes can only cover material that was found in the actual videos that are in the Foundations of Machine Learning on JuliaAcademy.org._ Please do not reference or ask questions about outside material that the person taking the quiz may not know.

To submit the task, upload a basic PDF with the questions and the 4 possible answers for each question. Each question in the PDF should also have a timestamp with the appropriate time in the lecture the student can refer to for the answer.

Note that by submitting content for this course, you acknowledge and consent to potentially having the material be used under an MIT license.
