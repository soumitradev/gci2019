> Hi there! I have finished the quiz (and attached it) and have claimed the topic on the thread.

> As asked by the task, I have included the timestamps for the answers to these questions just below the questions in grayed out text.

> Since the video for my topic is not particularly long, I have come up with 7 Questions which test the student on the video thoroughly.

> I feel I could do more for this task. If the website supports showing why an answer is wrong, I can come up with explanations as to why an option is wrong/correct for every option. Should I do this? I can submit this work in the next 24 hours.
