*   Upload feedback about the course to [this thread](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/JuliaAcademyMaterials/issues/24). Note that the comments do not need to be all positive. We are looking for feedback to improve the experience for students learning Julia!

**PLEASE DO NOT COPY OTHER STUDENTS WORK!**

Note that feedback on topics like Machine Learning is especially valuable given that the topic itself is inherently difficult. This means that just saying you agree with what everyone else said is not considered quality feedback.
