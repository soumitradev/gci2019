> Hi there! I have added an entire demo video instead of screenshots an a gif because the game is quite large, and it is tough to fit all the modes and features into a 6-15 second gif. The video is linked in the README.

> Here are the timestamps if you don't want to get bored for 7 minutes straight:
> 0:00 to 1:04: 8x8 easy mode demo
> 1:04 to 1:11: replay demo
> 1:11 to 6:55: 16x16 hard mode demo (I actually win this one!)
> 7:04 to 7:30: custom mode demo
> 7:30 to 7:33: don't replay demo

> Sure, I'll do that in about an hour.

> Hey Soumitra Shewale, you should add some screen shots or a short gif (better than screenshots) so that someone just browns your repo can quickly see how cool your game is without hang to load up atom and run the code. Thanks!

> Hi Somitra, just a few changes are needed. From the task description...

> "...Every game must end with the grid showing ALL THE TILES THAT HAVE BEEN UNCOVERED SO FAR and THE LOCATION OF ALL THE MINES...", with emphasis on "so far".

> This small hiccup aside, the game looks fantastic. Please correct it and I will approve!
