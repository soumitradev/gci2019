> Hi! I have finished the one-page summary and attached it. I used Photoshop to make it.

> I know this is not one page, but the course contains a *lot* of new definitions (mostly mathematical) and a lot of new ideas about how machines "learn", So I had to add a couple of pages to allow the entire course to be summarized.

> Sorry for the late submission, I had a quarterly exam on Friday, and I had to prepare for the exam on Wednesday, and Thursday.

> I have included credits in the document, but here's a copy of it for quick reference:
