> This looks awesome. Great job writing it up and benchmarking it. Publishing it as a gist is also super cool so you can showcase your code. Keep up the incredible work.

> Hi! I have written the code in form of a Jupyter Notebook, and have added Markdown explanation about how I came up with the algorithm. I have also benchmarked my algorithm and included the results in the same Notebook.

> My algorithm checks if two words are anagrams in a single line, and uses word length and an optimized 2D Array to speed up the process of finding anagrams.

> My Jupyter Notebook has all the explanation about how my code works, and also how I came up with the code. I have hosted it on a public gist here: https://gist.github.com/soumitradev/a23320fde2874755ffc388144a4cef12

> I have attached the same as a .html and .ipynb file incase you want to download it and review it offline.
>  AnagramFinder.ipynb (30.7 kB)
>  AnagramFinder.html (309.8 kB)
