> So far so good but I would ask to use mean time as benchmark and not total time. For example loading time of Images in 5 s in Julia is not presentable as a benchmark.

> Hi! I have benchmarked the Images.jl package on Julia compare to OpenCV (cv2) and PIL (Pillow) on Python 3.7. I have attached the Benchmarks as a zip file containing the Jupyter notebooks for the 3 frameworks. I have included a more detailed description and summary in the Notebooks.
