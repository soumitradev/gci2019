# Benchmarking JuliaImages against other image frameworks

JuliaImages provides high-quality implementations of many algorithms; however, as of yet there is no set of benchmarks that compares our code against that of other image-processing frameworks. Developing such benchmarks would allow us to advertise our strengths and/or identify opportunities for further improvement. See also the OpenCV project.

Some knowledge of other image processing tools (OpenCV, ImageMagick) would be useful for this task.
