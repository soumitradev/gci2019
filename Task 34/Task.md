# Make a rock-paper-scissors game in Julia without if/else statements

For this task, you will be creating a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Julia. The game should be single-player and be played against an AI that you make.

This should be pretty straightforward so the caveat for this task is that you must _not_ use if/else statements and are instead restricted to the use of the [Ternary Operator which you can learn about more here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/control-flow/#man-conditional-evaluation-1).

*   Create a Julia program that is a single-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
*   Upload the code to GitHub as a Gist, Notebook, or Repository and link it here.
*   Provide screenshots on GitHub of how the game is played.
*   Note that you can not use if/else statements.

Please ping us on here or Slack if there are issues/questions doing this task.
