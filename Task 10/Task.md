# Animate the Julia Logo

The Julia three-dots logo should be amenable to animation. The svg version of the logo can be found here: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia-logo-graphics/blob/master/images/julia-dots.svg .

One simple idea would be to spin it like a fidget spinner. But pay attention to the speed curve and bounce. But feel free to be more creative.

The Pixar Luxo Jr film is wonderful, and might be another inspiration. Note, of course, your animation does not need to be so complicated, but it's worth noticing the playfullness in Pixar's work.

Along with your finished graphic, upload a screenshot showing how you made it.
