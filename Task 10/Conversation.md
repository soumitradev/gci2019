> Hey there! I have made 5 animations (named Julia Animation 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and have included both .mp4 format and .aep format if you want to use my animation somewhere later. All the .mp4 files are rendered in 1920x1080 60fps while the After Effects projects are in 1920x1080 90fps.

> In animation 1, I took the fidget spinner idea and added some realness to it. I added some inertia to the animation so that the fidget spinner 'bounces' back to its place after animating. Also, if you notice, the animation gets slightly larger while at maximum speed. This is again to add some realness to it. It looks like some kind of centrifugal force is pulling it outwards. I also added a bit of motion blur to the animation. The animation I have uploaded is only one pulse/cycle, so to really review the animation in its true form, I would suggest you to loop it.

> In animation 2, I made all the circles move in triangles towards each other. Again, I have rendered only one cycle.

> Animation 3 is animation 2 with added motion blur. Again, I rendered only one cycle.

> In Animation 4, I made the circles travel to the center and outwards into another triangle. Also, note that every cycle, a different circle is the top layer.

> Animation 5 is animation 4 with added motion blur. Finally, this too was rendered as only one cycle.

> I made all these animations in After Effects.
